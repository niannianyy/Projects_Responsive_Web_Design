				<p id="tribute-info">The wild plant originates from the Paraná-Paraguay River drainages between southern Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
				<p id="tribute-info">Little is known about its domestication, but it spread as a crop throughout South America.</p>
				<p id="tribute-info">Archaeological evidence of cultivation/use is found as far back as 1200 - 800 BC (3200-2800 BP) in Peru and 200BC - AD700 (2200-1300 BP) in Mexico, where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs.</p>
				<p id="tribute-info">By the late 1400s, cropped pineapple was widely distributed and a stable component of the diet of Native Americans.</p>
				<p id="tribute-info">The first European to encounter the pineapple was Columbus, in Guadeloupe on 4 November 1493.</p>
				<p id="tribute-info">The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and introduced it into India by 1550.</p>
				<p id="tribute-info">The 'Red Spanish' cultivar was also introduced by the Spanish from Latin America to the Philippines, and it was grown for textile use from at least the 17th century.</p>
				<p id="tribute-info">Columbus brought the plant back to Spain and called it piña de Indes, meaning "pine of the Indians".</p>
				<p id="tribute-info">The pineapple was documented in Peter Martyr's Decades of the New World (1516) and Antonio Pigafetta's Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo (1524-1525), and the first known illustration was in Oviedo's Historia General de Las Indias (1535).</p>
